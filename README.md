Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

AIM: To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

ALGORITHM:

Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True. Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False. Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True. Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9. Print the value of a with the label "a is". Print the value of b with the label "b is". Print the value of c with the label "c:". Print the value of d with the label "d:".

🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

AIM: To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

ALGORITHM:

Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part). Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part). Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function. Print the complex number x. Print the real part of x using x.real. Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.

PROGRAM:

RESULT: Thus , the program has been executed succesfully.

Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

AIM: To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

ALGORITHM:

Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon. Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable. Print the value stored in the variable.

PROGRAM:

RESULT: Thus , the program has been executed succesfully.

Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

AIM: To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

ALGORITHM:

Get an input from the user. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a. Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0. If true, print "EVEN". Else, print "ODD". End the program.
